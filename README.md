# README
All money figures are in cents unless stated otherwise... but they shouldn't be in other amounts
All interest figures are represented the way you'd say them
  ex:  4.5 percent is represented as 4.5 (not 0.045)

## TODO:
-  figure out how we want to use this model
    do we want to pull reports for properties?  ask umma and appa cities?

- fix uniqeuness validation - this breaks specs

- extract compound calc - make it independent of alternative ROIs

# COCKTAIL calcs:

compound interest:  figure out how to calculate this by calculating how long it'll take to get to a certain end amount
https://www.thecalculatorsite.com/articles/finance/compound-interest-formula.php

house:
  starting principal = downpayment + ( - closing costs + additional payments + additional costs)
    total return will be the total property value
     x - how do you calc appreciation?

  ex: 20k + (5k + additional_payments + 2k)

  calc time to loan paydown
  compare it to compound interest

also compare 20, 30 & 60 yrs

add RE vs alternative investing later
