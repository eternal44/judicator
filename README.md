  not sure why it's not working
  https://www.mortgagecalculator.biz/c/additional-payments.php

All money figures are in cents unless stated otherwise... but they shouldn't be in other amounts
All interest figures are represented the way you'd say them
  ex:  4.5 percent is represented as 4.5 (not 0.045)

## TODO:

    do we want to pull reports for properties?
